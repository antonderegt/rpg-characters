## Heroes

Primary attributes are what determine the characters power, as the character levels up their primary attributes
increase. Items they equip also can increase these primary attributes (this is detailed in Appendix B). Secondary
attributes affect the charactersâ€™ ability to survive, they are calculated from primary attributes. Certain character classes
are more durable against certain types of damage.
